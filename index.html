	<h2>Project Description</h2>
	<p>This project comprises a hypothetical world below the “sea”.
		The world is as dark as the bottom of a deep sea with some ambient lighting just enough to observe the world closest to you. 
		In this world, there are agents (sea life agents) of varying sizes and or types.
		Users can enter this world through a VR head-mounted headset or a desktop or mobile device such as a phone or tablet.
		Multiple users across different platforms can access this world at the same time.
		Users in this world take up the form of a light-emitting creature.
		The user’s avatar across platforms including VR is a light source.
		Users can throw light bulbs from their controller or pointer.
		Users in VR can walk around, crouch, and jump in the world for navigation
		Users on other platforms can navigate using “flyControls” and joysticks or WASD.
		When users launch a glowing ball within the space, the ball drops slowly to the ground.
		Users can release the control to retract the ball or the ball can retract automatically after a moment.
		The agents (sealife agents) are constantly seeking out light sources.
		Agents closer to the user will curiously flock around the user as a light source.
		When the glowing balls are launched into the space, the agents closest to the ball actively seek out the light source as it falls to the ground.
		As the ball falls to the ground, it releases a wave that makes the agents closest to it behave erratically hunting each other, and reducing in number. 
		When there are no lights in the space, the agents reproduce and grow in number until a certain maximum.
		All interactions and reactions in this world will produce different feedback from vibrations to sound. (reproduction, death, wave, shock, launching and retracting of light balls, ambiance, navigation, etc)
